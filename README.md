# Simple Dice Game 🎲

## Overview
A simple two-player dice rolling game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The game simulates a dice roll for both players, compares the results, and displays the winner or a draw. It's a fun way to understand random number generation, DOM manipulation, and basic interactivity in web development.

## Features 🌟
- **Random Dice Rolls**: Players get random dice rolls between 1 and 6.
- **Player Comparison**: The dice images for Player 1 and Player 2 are displayed. The game will show who won, or if there is a draw.
- **Responsive UI**: The game is designed to work seamlessly across different screen sizes.
- **Interactive**: Each time the page is refreshed, the dice rolls and results change.

1. When you refresh the page, two dice images will randomly be selected for Player 1 and Player 2.
2. The game compares the dice rolls and determines the winner (Player 1 or Player 2) based on the higher dice value.
3. If both dice rolls are the same, a **DRAW** is displayed.
